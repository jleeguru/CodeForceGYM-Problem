Mr. Panda recently received a bucket of toy blocks as his birthday gift. Each block is a 1×1×2
 cuboid, which is constructed by a pair of face-to-face 1×1×1
 colored cubes. There are n
 types of colors, labeled as 1,2,…,n
.

Mr. Panda checked all of the blocks, and he found that he had just n×(n+1)2
 blocks and each of these blocks was painted with a unique pair of colors. That is, for each pair of colors (i,j)
 (1≤i≤j≤n)
, he had exactly one block with one cube colored i
, and the other colored j
.

Mr. Panda plans to build a fantastic castle with these blocks today.
